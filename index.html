    <!-- * The user arrives at the landing page 
    and is presented with a call-to-action to "Start Quiz." 
    Also note the navigation option to "View Highscores" 
    and the "Time" value set at 0.

    Clicking the "Start Quiz" button presents the user with a series of questions. 
    The timer is initialized with a value and immediately begins countdown.
  
    * Score is calculated by time remaining. Answering quickly and correctly results in a higher score. Answering incorrectly results in a time penalty (for example, 15 seconds are subtracted from time remaining).
  
    * When time runs out and/or all questions are answered, the user is presented with their final score and asked to enter their initials. Their final score and initials are then stored in `localStorage`. -->

    <!-- Functional, deployed application.

    * GitHub repository with README describing project.
    
    * The first view of the application displays a button that starts the quiz.
    
    * Clicking the start button displays a series of questions.
    
    * Once the quiz begins, a timer starts.
    
    * If a question is answered incorrectly, additional time is subtracted from the timer.
    
    * The timer stops when all questions have been answered or the timer reaches 0.
    
    * After the game ends, the user can save their initials and score to a highscores view using local storage.
    
    ## Bonus
    
    * Add audio files to alert the user of correct or incorrect answers. Be sure to include the appropriate license.
    
    * Customize the application theme.
    
    * Create multiple quizzes and an option for users to choose between them.
    
    * Add the application to your portfolio. -->
