# Quiz-Challenge
A timed quiz that stores high scores

## Welcome to the Trivia Quiz where you will be tested on your random trivia knowledge.

#### Scoring
Your score is calculated by your time remaining when you complete the quiz.

Get a question **right**, and you'll move on to the next question.

Get an answer **wrong**, and 15 seconds will be deducted from your remaining time and you have a chance to choose again.

Get the HIGH SCORE to win!

##### BONUS: if you can plug your nose and hum at the same time, you also win.

Features
Questions are stored in an array, but buttons are created dynamically.

### Still to-do:
+ High Scores scene
+ local storage for high scores
+ (endgame function) Finish game/timer expires =  calls final score/high score screen
+ hide High Scores navigation button during active game
+ fix method of calling next in array instead of copy/pasting reusable code...
